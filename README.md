##Classic Pong Game

## Description

This game is based on the Pong game from the 1970's, with the sounds and 'feel' 
similar to the original developed by Atari Engineer Alan Alcorn. It uses multiple 
sprites, asynchronous scripts, 'for loop' functions, as well as variables for 
"puck" movement, scoring and sound effects.
